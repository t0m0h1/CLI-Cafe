This is a weird project that i thought up while drinking coffee.

The first iteration is just a series of conditional statements based around the choice the user generates.

The second is based around the integer the choice makes, in this case a random choice performed by the randint() function, range specified as between the coffee numbers - this list serves as a reference/ index in itself to allow the type sensitive functions to work.


Further iterations could be some sort of recurring choice, or possibly even measure how many times the random choice picks an item using data analyses (matplotlib etc).
